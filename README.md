# proxying-likes

For this project a deep feedforward network is built and trained on metadata features about tracks from two different users' Spotify likes with the aim of classifying unseen songs by probably playlist membership. 

The data is contained within the Jupyter notebook where track data is saved as a CSV which can be loaded. 

To run with data from one's own playlists, the OAUTH token can be retrieved from Spotify for developers and used in place of the ones presently in the file.
